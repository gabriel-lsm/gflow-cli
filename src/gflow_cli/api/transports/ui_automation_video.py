"""Video-generation methods for UiAutomationTransport.

Mixed into `UiAutomationTransport` via `VideoGenerationMixin` — kept in its own
module because `ui_automation.py` is already over the 800-line cap.

Video generation mirrors `generate_images`: the transport drives the Flow
editor UI and Flow's own JavaScript builds the request, sends it, and mints
reCAPTCHA on submit — the transport never POSTs a generate body. The status
endpoint returns HTTP 401 to `page.request.post`, so polling captures Flow's
own `batchCheckAsyncVideoGenerationStatus` responses instead of issuing the
POST (spec §5.5).

# Composer "Agent" mode toggle. Flow's newer editor puts a pill toggle next to
# the prompt box: a ``<button>`` whose only label is a ``<span class="content">``.
# When Agent mode is on, the whole media-generation panel is REMOVED from the
# DOM — the aspect/settings button (the locale-stable ``crop_*`` icon trigger
# keyed on by MODE_SWITCH_TRIGGER_SELECTORS / GEN_SETTINGS_BUTTON_SELECTORS), the
# Image/Video tablist, and the count/model controls all disappear, so
# ``_switch_to_image_mode`` / ``_switch_to_video_mode`` raise "mode-switch
# dropdown trigger not found". Clicking the pill returns to media mode.
#
# This selector is deliberately STRUCTURAL — no localized text and no ARIA:
#  * No localized text: the pill's "Agent" label is translated in some Flow
#    locales, so matching it by visible text would regress non-English users
#    (issue #24: locale-agnostic selectors — a recurring source of PR pushback in
#    this module). The only ``:text(...)`` here is ``arrow_forward``, a Material
#    Symbols icon ligature, which is locale-invariant — the same technique the
#    module already uses for ``crop_*`` / SUBMIT_BUTTON_SELECTORS anchors.
#  * No ARIA: aria-* anchors have also been pushed back on in past reviews, and
#    one is not needed here — Agent mode is detected from the *absence* of the
#    ``crop_*`` media trigger, so the toggle only has to be located, not have its
#    state read.
#
# SCOPED to the generation composer (PR #124 review must-fix): the pill is
# matched only inside the element that holds BOTH the Slate prompt box AND the
# ``arrow_forward`` submit button. Page-wide there is exactly one
# ``button:has(span.content)`` today (live-verified count == 1), but ``.first``
# on the bare global selector would silently grab the wrong element if a future
# Flow build added another ``span.content`` button (header/sidebar) ordered
# before the pill. Scoping to the prompt+submit composer keeps the match correct
# regardless of unrelated additions elsewhere. The composer's own ancestor chain
# carries no stable id/role/data-* attribute (all styled-component hashes), so
# the prompt box and submit icon ARE the stable structural anchors. Uniqueness is
# pinned by a structural unit test (decoy outside the composer) and asserted live
# (count == 1) in the e2e.

# (div[aria-haspopup='dialog'] labelled Start/End) -> 'Upload media' (opens a
# file chooser) -> wait uploadImage -> 'Add to Prompt' to commit it into the
# slot. Only then does the DOM Generate click fire StartImage/StartAndEndImage.

# Frame slots are `<div type="button" aria-haspopup="dialog">` — Flow uses a

# Tier 1 (PRIMARY, locale-free): `FRAME_SLOTS_STRUCT` matches the exact pair via
# the `type='button'` + `aria-haspopup='dialog'` composite — a unique pattern in
# Flow's editor (regular elements don't carry a `type` attr on divs). Order is
# DOM order: `.nth(0)` = Start, `.nth(1)` = End.
#
# Tier 2 (FALLBACK, EN-only): `FRAME_SLOT_BY_LABEL` matches by visible English
# text. Kept for defense-in-depth in case Flow drops the `type` attribute on
# the slots; the fail-loud `RuntimeError` in `_attach_frame` covers the case
# where both tiers miss on a non-EN profile.
#

# Earlier PR #70 used a structural anchor
#   `div:has(> button:has(i.google-symbols:text-is('swap_horiz')))`
# as the parent of the dialog slots. That anchor was broken on real Flow DOMs because
# (1) the slots are `<div type="button">` not children of any `div > button`
# wrapper, and (2) the `swap_horiz` icon uses class `material-icons` (NOT
# `google-symbols`). PR #70's structural tier therefore matched ZERO elements
# on every profile, silently falling through to the text-tier which only
# matched on EN. This was discovered 2026-05-26 via DOM probe on pt-BR — see
# scripts/dev/capture_i2v_frame_slots_dom.py.

# pt-BR / th / ... profile -> the file chooser never opens -> 34s hang (#56).
