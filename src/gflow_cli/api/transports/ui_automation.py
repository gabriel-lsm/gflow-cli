"""D.2.4 UiAutomationTransport — Playwright persistent-context driver for Flow.

Empirically validated 2026-05-12: mirrors the proven CG Worker pattern
(``scripts/smoke_worker_style.py``). Playwright manages its own internal CDP
port, the strategy reuses a pre-authenticated profile dir, and prompts are
submitted by typing into Flow's editor — the same surface a human developer
uses on a Pro/Ultra plan. ``batchGenerateImages`` responses are captured via
``page.on("response")`` and parsed for image URLs.

Implementation arrives in per-method TDD units; this skeleton pins the
Protocol contract.

        Flow generates N images via N separate API calls (not one call with
        N URLs). We poll until we have enough fresh responses (those whose
        ``ts >= submit_time``) or the timeout expires.

        **Defense A — post-submit-time filter (primary correctness fix):**
        Each captured entry carries a ``ts`` field written by the handler at
        append time (``time.monotonic()``). Only entries with
        ``entry["ts"] >= submit_time`` count toward ``expected_count``.  This
        eliminates the cross-contamination bug where a listener attached
        *before* the submit click inherits stale responses from prior prompts
        that arrived in the window between attach and click.

        When ``submit_time`` is 0.0 (the default, used by
        ``_capture_batch_response`` and legacy callers), all entries pass the
        filter, preserving backwards compatibility.

        **Straggler window:** after the count threshold is first reached the
        method waits an additional ``straggler_window_s`` seconds so that any
        slower same-submission responses (e.g. the last of a 2-image batch)
        can arrive before the list is snapshotted. This mirrors the Worker
        pattern (``_wait_for_n_new_images`` in the compile-growth monorepo).

        Raises ``TimeoutError`` if no fresh responses arrive within
        ``timeout_s``.  Returns the underlying response dicts (entries without
        the ``ts`` wrapper key) for entries with ``ts >= submit_time``.

           remain, prefer the first (the slot-add renders adjacent to the
           character image slots, ahead of any other icon-only ``add_2``).
